title: Methods
description: We asked 7 subects to undergo 10 MRI sessions, one week apart, and perform a BH task. We acquired ME data and applied different ME-ICA based denoising to remove motion effects. We then compared the reliability of each pipeline using intraclass correlation coefficient and measureing the relation between FD and DVARS.

Seven healthy volunteers underwent 10 MRI sessions in a 3T Siemens PrismaFit scanner, spaced 1-week apart at the same time of day. A BH task (Fig. 1) adapted from [7] was administered at each session while collecting ME-fMRI data (340 scans, TR=1.5 s, TEs=10.6/28.69/46.78/64.87/82.96 ms, flip angle=70Â°, MB=4, GRAPPA=2, 52 slices, Partial-Fourier=6/8, FoV=211x211 mm2, voxel size=2.4x2.4x3 mm3). CO2 levels were measured using a nasal cannula, a gas analyzer (ADInstruments), and a BIOPAC MP150 system.
Data preprocessing and data analysis followed the same steps reported in [8]. Briefly, after a minimal data preprocessing (Fig. 2), CVR and lag maps were first obtained in the second TE (SE) and OC data (GLM with lagged HRF-convolved PETCO2 timeseries as covariate of interest; 12 motion parameters and Legendre polynomials as nuisance regressors, SE-MPR or OC-MPR, Fig. 3). 
The optimally combined volume was decomposed using ME-ICA [9], then noise and signal ICs were manually labelled, and three additional extended GLMs were created: adding the noise ICs timeseries directly as additional nuisance regressors (ME-AGG); orthogonalized w.r.t. the PETCO2 trace (ME-MOD); or orthogonalised w.r.t. the PETCO2 trace and signal ICs timeseries (ME-CON). FD [10] and DVARS [11] were computed before realignment (SE-PRE) and after removal of the fitted nuisance regressors from SE and OC data. The CVR and lag maps were registered to the MNI space, then ICC(2,1) [12] was computed to assess their reliability across sessions.
