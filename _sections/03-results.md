In most subjects, RSFA shows a moderate spatial correlation with both positive and negative CVR. However, this correlation varies greatly depending on the subject (Figure 2 and 3).
At the voxel level, the reliability of positive CVR is systematically higher than that of RSFA (Figure 4). The same can be observed in negative CVR voxels (Figure 5).
At the parcel level, the reliability of positive CVR is generally high, especially in frontal, occipital, and subcortical areas, but it shows extremely high spatial variability; RSFA has low reliability that is spatially more homogeneous. With the exception of few areas, both ICC(1) maps appear to be fairly symmetrical across hemispheres (Figure 6). Due to the little number of negative CVR voxels, such comparison couldn't be performed on negative CVR.
